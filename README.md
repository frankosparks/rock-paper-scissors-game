This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game.
When you click one of the icons; either rock,paper or scisors, the computer makes its move.
After this, it is displayed where one has won,lost or has tied with the computer.
Icons the player and the computer has chosen are then displayed.
The results are recorded and stored in the local storage.
There is a rest button to reset the score and erase it from local storage and the game begins recording once again.
